## Description

The Challenge for Module #9 asked us to create a ReadMe generator using Node.js. There was no method to demo this app in the browser, so we were tasked with screencasting a demonstration to prove functionality.

## Usage

First, copy the app files into a code editor.  
Open the index.js in the integrated terminal.  
Type <i>node index.js</i> in the terminal and press return.  
Answer each question and press return after each answer. To select from the license list, use your arrow keys to select the license you want, then press return.
When you have answered all of the questions, the ReadMe file will be generated in the file list in your editor. Click on it to view, or right-click to Open Preview.


## Challenges

The biggest challenge for this project was the creation of the ReadMe skeleton. Markdown is not a language that I know well, and so that learning curve led to a lot of extra testing to make sure that everything was formatted correctly. Writing my first "official" switch case was also a challenge, but was ultimately pretty cool.



## Credits

Initial source code and assets were provided through the University of Texas at Austin Bootcamp, and was provided in the challenge documentation itself.

Additional guidance was given by instructor Leah Nelson in office hours. Tutor Dru Sanchez also provided guidance.
